# NumberGuess-MarioTheme

This JavaScript code creates a number guessing game. It gives the user a chance to guess a random number.

How does it work?

1. Game Launch: When the page loads or the "Reset" button is clicked, the game is launched. A random number is generated and the user's health is set to 100%.

2. Making a Prediction: When the user clicks on the "Play" button, he enters his prediction and submits it. The entered guess is compared to the randomly generated number.

3. Game Status Check: If the prediction is not correct, the user's health points are reduced and feedback is given. If health points drop to 0 or the user wins, the game ends.

4. Game Reset: User can click "Reset" button to reset and restart the game.

##

Features:

- Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number each time it is played, making each game different.

- Health Status Indicator: The user's health status is displayed with a progress bar. With each incorrect guess, the health score decreases and feedback is given to the user.

- Win and Lose Control: If the user guesses correctly, he wins. If the health point drops to 0, the user loses and the game ends.

This code allows users to have fun playing a simple game and can help them learn about basic JavaScript logic and interactions.
